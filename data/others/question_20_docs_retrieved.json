Effect of changes in law \n \nA person cannot be punished for doing or omitting to do an act, unless the act or omission constituted an offence under the law in force when it occurred, nor unless doing or omitting to do the act under the same circumstances would constitute an offence under the law in force at the time when he is charged with the offence. \n \n[Section 11 amended: No. 78 of 1995 s. 26.] \n12.

Offence aided, counselled or procured by person out of WA \n \nWhen an offence under this Code or any other law of Western Australia is committed, section 7 of this Code applies to a person even if all the acts or omissions of the person in \u2014 \n \n(a) enabling or aiding another person to commit the offence; or \n \n(b) aiding another person in committing the offence; or \n \n(c) counselling or procuring another person to commit the offence, \n \noccurred outside Western Australia. \n \n[Section 13 inserted: No. 36 of 1996 s. 5(1)\n 2\n.] \n14. Offence procured in WA to be committed out of WA \n \nAny person who, while in Western Australia, procures another to do an act or make an omission at a place not in Western Australia of such a nature that, if he had himself done the act or made the omission in Western Australia, he would have been guilty of an offence, and that, if he had himself done the act or made the omission, he would have been guilty of an offence under the laws in force in the place where the act or omission is done or made, is guilty of an offence of the same kind, and is \n \n \n \n \n \n \n[Section 14 amended: No. 36 of 1996 s. 6(1)\n 3\n.] [\n14A.\n \nDeleted: No. 101 of 1990 s. 5.] \n15.
