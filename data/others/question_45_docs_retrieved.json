Obligation to identify a cat\u2019s owner \n \n(1) If the identity of the owner of a cat entering a cat management facility is unknown to the operator of the facility, then, as soon as practicable after the cat enters the facility the operator must make every reasonable attempt to identify the owner of the cat including, where possible, by scanning the cat. \n \nPenalty: a fine of $5 000. \n \n(2) Despite subsection (1), a person does not have to scan a cat if \u2014  \n \n(a) the cat behaves aggressively towards the person or any other person; and \n \n(b) the person believes on reasonable grounds that there is a danger to the health or safety of any person in attempting to scan the cat. \n31. Cat owner liable to pay costs to cat management facility \n \n(1) The owner of a cat kept at a cat management facility is liable to pay to the operator of the facility the reasonable costs associated with any of the following that have been incurred in relation to the cat \u2014  \n \n(a) removing and impounding the cat; \n \n(b) keeping and caring for the cat; \n \n(c) the implantation of a microchip in the cat under section 33; \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the sterilisation of the cat under section 33; \n \n(e) the destruction and the disposal of the cat under section 34. \n \n(2) The operator of a cat management facility may recover the amount of the costs referred to in subsection (1) from the owner of the cat in a court of competent jurisdiction. \n32. Notice to be given to cat\u2019s owner, if identified \n \nIf the operator of a cat management facility knows the identity of the owner of a cat kept at the facility then the operator is to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the owner of the cat is notified in writing \u2014  \n \n(a) of the name and address of the cat management facility where the cat is being kept; and \n \n(b) that the cat may be re-housed, offered for sale or destroyed if the cat is not reclaimed by its owner within the holding period specified in the notice (that is not to be less than 7 working days from the notice being given); and \n \n(c) of the costs that the owner may be liable for under section 31; and \n \n(d) where relevant, that under section 33 \u2014  \n \n(i) the cat is to be microchipped, unless it is proved to the satisfaction of the operator, within the holding period specified in the notice, that the cat is exempt from microchipping as referred to in section 14(2); \n \n(ii) that the cat is to be sterilised, unless it is proved to the satisfaction of the operator, within the holding period specified in the notice, that the cat is exempt from sterilisation as referred to in section 18(2). \n \nPenalty: a fine of $5 000. \n \n \n \n \n \n33. Operator of cat management facility may have cat microchipped and sterilised \n \nIf the operator of a cat management facility \u2014  \n \n(a) believes on reasonable grounds that a cat kept at the facility is not microchipped, and has no reason to believe that the cat is exempt from microchipping as referred to in section 14(2); or \n \n(b) believes on reasonable grounds that a cat kept at the facility is not sterilised, and has no reason to believe that the cat is exempt from sterilisation as referred to in section 18(2), \n \nthen the operator of the cat management facility may do anything necessary to ensure that the cat is microchipped or sterilised, or both, as is relevant, before the cat is reclaimed or otherwise transferred from that facility. \n34. Dealing with unidentified and unclaimed cats \n \n(1) If \u2014  \n \n(a) the operator of a cat management facility does not know the identity of the owner of a cat and fails to identify the owner within 3 working days of the cat entering the cat management facility; or \n \n(b) the owner of a cat notified under section 32 has not reclaimed the cat within \u2014  \n \n(i) 7 working days from the notice being given under that section; or \n \n(ii) the holding period specified in the notice, \n \nwhichever is later; or \n \n(c) the owner of a cat has surrendered the cat to the cat management facility, \n \nthen the operator of the facility may \u2014  \n \n(d) transfer the cat; or \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) cause the cat to be destroyed in a humane manner. \n \n(2) Despite subsection (1), the operator of a cat management facility may cause any cat kept at the facility to be destroyed in a humane manner immediately \u2014  \n \n(a) if the operator believes on reasonable grounds that the cat \u2014  \n \n(i) is feral, diseased or dangerous; and \n \n----\n(4) A local government is to administer any regulation made under this section to the extent that it relates to any place where the local government may perform functions, as if the regulation were a local law. \n \n(5) Unless a contrary intention appears, a reference to an offence against a local law includes a reference to an offence against a regulation made under this section. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(6) If there is any inconsistency between a regulation made under this section and a local law made under this Act, the regulation prevails to the extent of the inconsistency. \n78. Provisions about regulations \n \nRegulations, whether under section 76 or 77, may \u2014  \n \n(a) adopt any text that could be adopted by a local law; \n \n(b) provide that contravention of a provision of regulations is an offence, and provide for the offence to be punishable on conviction by the imposition of a fine not exceeding $5 000; \n \n(c) make a person who commits an offence of a continuing nature liable to a further fine not exceeding $500 in respect of each day or part of a day during which the offence has continued; \n \n(d) provide for the imposition of a minimum fine for the offence; \n \n(e) relate the level of the fine to \u2014  \n \n(i) the circumstances or extent of the offence; \n \n(ii) whether the offender has committed previous offences and, if so, the number of previous offences that the offender has committed; \n \n(f) prescribe the method and the means by which any fines imposed are to be paid and collected, or recovered. \nDivision 2 \u2014 Local laws \n79. Local laws \n \n(1) A local government may make local laws prescribing all matters that are required or permitted to be prescribed by a local law, or are necessary or convenient to be so prescribed, for it to perform any of its functions under this Act. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(2) A local law made under this Act does not apply outside the local government\u2019s district unless it is made to apply outside the district under section 80. \n \n(3) Without limiting subsection (1), a local law may be made as to one or more of the following \u2014  \n \n(a) the registration of cats; \n \n(b) removing and impounding cats; \n \n(c) keeping, transferring and disposing of cats kept at cat management facilities; \n \n(d) the humane destruction of cats; \n \n(e) cats creating a nuisance; \n \n(f) specifying places where cats are prohibited absolutely; \n \n(g) requiring that in specified areas a portion of the premises on which a cat is kept must be enclosed in a manner capable of confining cats; \n \n(h) limiting the number of cats that may be kept at premises, or premises of a particular type; \n \n(i) the establishment, maintenance, licensing, regulation, construction, use, record keeping and inspection of cat management facilities; \n \n(j) the regulation of approved cat breeders, including record keeping and inspection; \n \n(k) fees and charges payable in respect of any matter under this Act. \n80. Places outside district \n \n(1) If the Governor\u2019s approval has been first obtained, a local government may make a local law under this Act that applies outside its district. \n \n(2) A local government cannot, under subsection (1), make a local law that applies to \u2014  \n \n(a) a part of the State that is in the district of another local government; or \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) a part of the State to which a local law made by another local government concerning the same subject matter applies under this section. \n \n(3) The Governor may revoke any approval given under subsection (1), and, after that revocation, a local law made under the approval ceases to apply to the part of the State for which the approval was given. \n \n(4) The Minister is to cause notice of any revocation under subsection (3) to be published in the \nGazette\n. \n81.

Cat owner liable to pay costs to cat management facility \n \n(1) The owner of a cat kept at a cat management facility is liable to pay to the operator of the facility the reasonable costs associated with any of the following that have been incurred in relation to the cat \u2014  \n \n(a) removing and impounding the cat; \n \n(b) keeping and caring for the cat; \n \n(c) the implantation of a microchip in the cat under section 33; \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the sterilisation of the cat under section 33; \n \n(e) the destruction and the disposal of the cat under section 34. \n \n(2) The operator of a cat management facility may recover the amount of the costs referred to in subsection (1) from the owner of the cat in a court of competent jurisdiction. \n32. Notice to be given to cat\u2019s owner, if identified \n \nIf the operator of a cat management facility knows the identity of the owner of a cat kept at the facility then the operator is to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the owner of the cat is notified in writing \u2014  \n \n(a) of the name and address of the cat management facility where the cat is being kept; and \n \n(b) that the cat may be re-housed, offered for sale or destroyed if the cat is not reclaimed by its owner within the holding period specified in the notice (that is not to be less than 7 working days from the notice being given); and \n \n(c) of the costs that the owner may be liable for under section 31; and \n \n(d) where relevant, that under section 33 \u2014  \n \n(i) the cat is to be microchipped, unless it is proved to the satisfaction of the operator, within the holding period specified in the notice, that the cat is exempt from microchipping as referred to in section 14(2); \n \n(ii) that the cat is to be sterilised, unless it is proved to the satisfaction of the operator, within the holding period specified in the notice, that the cat is exempt from sterilisation as referred to in section 18(2). \n \nPenalty: a fine of $5 000. \n \n \n \n \n \n33.
