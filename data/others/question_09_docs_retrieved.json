(10) An accused who is committed for sentence under subsection (9) is liable to the penalty with which the offence is punishable on indictment.  (11) For the purposes of this section and of any summary trial of the charge, the court must be constituted by a magistrate alone. \n \n[Section 5 inserted: No. 4 of 2004 s. 29; amended: No. 59 of 2004 s. 80; No. 84 of 2004 s. 28 and 82; No. 49 of 2012 s. 173(2).] \n \n \n \n \n \n6. Terms used: carnal knowledge, carnal connection \n \nWhen the term \ncarnal knowledge\n or the term \ncarnal connection\n \nis used in defining an offence, it is implied that the offence, so far as regards that element of it, is complete upon penetration. \n \nPenetration includes penetration of the anus of a female or male person. \n \n[Section 6 amended: No. 32 of 1989 s. 4.] \nChapter II \u2014 Parties to offence \n7. Principal offenders \n \nWhen an offence is committed, each of the following persons is deemed to have taken part in committing the offence and to be guilty of the offence, and may be charged with actually committing it, that is to say \u2014 \n \n(a) Every person who actually does the act or makes the omission which constitutes the offence; \n \n(b) Every person who does or omits to do any act for the purpose of enabling or aiding another person to commit the offence; \n \n(c) Every person who aids another person in committing the offence; \n \n(d) Any person who counsels or procures any other person to commit the offence. \n \nIn the fourth case he may be charged either with himself committing the offence or with counselling or procuring its commission. \n \n----\n(a) the person does an act that would constitute a prescribed offence in relation to another person with whom the person is in a designated family relationship; and \n \n(b) the person is not a child at the time of doing the act. \n \n(5) For the purposes of this section and section 300, a person \npersistently engages in family violence\n if the person does an act \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(6) For the purposes of subsection (5), the acts of family violence \u2014 \n \n(a) need not all constitute the same prescribed offence; and \n \n(b) need not all have occurred in this State as long as at least 1 of them did. \n \n(7) However, in relation to an act that constitutes a simple offence, an act cannot be an act of family violence if the date at the end of the period during which it is alleged that the acts of family violence occurred for the purposes of this section is outside the period during which it would be possible to charge the accused person with that offence. \n \n[Section 299 inserted: No. 30 of 2020 s. 6.] \n300.

(10) For the purposes of this section, an act that constitutes a prescribed offence may have occurred before the commencement of this section, unless the prescribed offence was not an offence at the time at which the act occurred. \n \n[Section 300 inserted: No. 30 of 2020 s. 6.] \n301. Wounding and similar acts \n \nAny person who \u2014 \n \n(1) Unlawfully wounds another; or \n \n(2) Unlawfully, and with intent to injure or annoy any person, causes any poison or other noxious thing to be administered to or taken by any person; \n \nis guilty of a crime, and is liable \u2014 \n \n(a) if the offence is committed in circumstances of aggravation, to imprisonment for 7 years; or \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) in any other case, to imprisonment for 5 years. \n \nSummary conviction penalty: \n ",

(10) An accused who is committed for sentence under subsection (9) is liable to the penalty with which the offence is punishable on indictment.  (11) For the purposes of this section and of any summary trial of the charge, the court must be constituted by a magistrate alone. \n \n[Section 5 inserted: No. 4 of 2004 s. 29; amended: No. 59 of 2004 s. 80; No. 84 of 2004 s. 28 and 82; No. 49 of 2012 s. 173(2).] \n \n \n \n \n \n6. Terms used: carnal knowledge, carnal connection \n \nWhen the term \ncarnal knowledge\n or the term \ncarnal connection\n \nis used in defining an offence, it is implied that the offence, so far as regards that element of it, is complete upon penetration. \n \nPenetration includes penetration of the anus of a female or male person. \n \n[Section 6 amended: No. 32 of 1989 s. 4.] \nChapter II \u2014 Parties to offence \n7. Principal offenders \n \nWhen an offence is committed, each of the following persons is deemed to have taken part in committing the offence and to be guilty of the offence, and may be charged with actually committing it, that is to say \u2014 \n \n(a) Every person who actually does the act or makes the omission which constitutes the offence; \n \n(b) Every person who does or omits to do any act for the purpose of enabling or aiding another person to commit the offence; \n \n(c) Every person who aids another person in committing the offence; \n \n(d) Any person who counsels or procures any other person to commit the offence. \n \nIn the fourth case he may be charged either with himself committing the offence or with counselling or procuring its commission. \n \n----\n(a) the person does an act that would constitute a prescribed offence in relation to another person with whom the person is in a designated family relationship; and \n \n(b) the person is not a child at the time of doing the act. \n \n(5) For the purposes of this section and section 300, a person \npersistently engages in family violence\n if the person does an act \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(6) For the purposes of subsection (5), the acts of family violence \u2014 \n \n(a) need not all constitute the same prescribed offence; and \n \n(b) need not all have occurred in this State as long as at least 1 of them did. \n \n(7) However, in relation to an act that constitutes a simple offence, an act cannot be an act of family violence if the date at the end of the period during which it is alleged that the acts of family violence occurred for the purposes of this section is outside the period during which it would be possible to charge the accused person with that offence. \n \n[Section 299 inserted: No. 30 of 2020 s. 6.] \n300. Persistent family violence \n \n(1) A person commits a crime if the person persistently engages in family violence. \n \nPenalty for this subsection: imprisonment for 14 years. \n \nSummary conviction penalty for this subsection: imprisonment for 3 years and a fine of $36 000. \n \n(2) A charge of an offence under subsection (1) \u2014 \n \n(a) must specify the period during which it is alleged that the acts of family violence occurred; and \n \n(b) need not specify the dates, or in any other way particularise the circumstances, of the acts of family violence that are alleged to constitute the offence. \n \n(3) Subsection (2) applies despite the \nCriminal Procedure Act 2004\n \nsections 23 and 85. \n \n \n \n \n \n(4) A person may be charged with both \u2014 \n \n(a) an offence against subsection (1); and \n \n(b) 1 or more prescribed offences that are alleged to have occurred in the period during which it is alleged that the acts of family violence constituting the offence under subsection (1) occurred (including an offence or offences allegedly constituted by an act or acts that are the subject of allegations made for the purposes of an offence against subsection (1)). \n \n(5) A court cannot order the prosecutor to give a person charged with an offence under subsection (1) further particulars of the dates and circumstances of the acts of family violence that are alleged to constitute the offence, despite the \nCriminal Procedure Act 2004\n section 131. \n \n(6) If in a trial by jury of a charge of an offence under subsection (1) there is evidence of acts of family violence on 4 or more occasions, the jury members need not all be satisfied that the same acts of family violence occurred on the same occasions as long as the jury is satisfied that the accused person persistently engaged in acts of family violence in the period specified. \n \n(7) If a person is found not guilty of an offence against subsection (1), the person may nevertheless be found guilty of 1 or more prescribed offences committed during the period specified in the charge for the offence against that subsection if the commission of the prescribed offence or prescribed offences is established by the evidence even if the person has not been charged with one or more of those prescribed offences, despite section 10A. \n \n(8) However \u2014  \n \n(a) if a person has been convicted or acquitted of a prescribed offence, the act constituting the prescribed offence cannot constitute an act of family violence for \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) if a person has been convicted or acquitted of an offence against subsection (1), the person cannot, in separate or subsequent proceedings, be found guilty of a prescribed offence constituted by an act that was the subject of evidence presented to the court for the purposes of proceedings for the offence against subsection (1); and \n \n(c) nothing in this section otherwise allows a person to be punished twice for the same act. \n \n(9) For the purposes of this section, a person ceases to be regarded as having been convicted of an offence if the conviction is set aside or quashed.  (10) For the purposes of this section, an act that constitutes a prescribed offence may have occurred before the commencement of this section, unless the prescribed offence was not an offence at the time at which the act occurred. \n \n[Section 300 inserted: No. 30 of 2020 s. 6.] \n301. Wounding and similar acts \n \nAny person who \u2014 \n \n(1) Unlawfully wounds another; or \n \n(2) Unlawfully, and with intent to injure or annoy any person, causes any poison or other noxious thing to be administered to or taken by any person; \n \nis guilty of a crime, and is liable \u2014 \n \n(a) if the offence is committed in circumstances of aggravation, to imprisonment for 7 years; or \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) in any other case, to imprisonment for 5 years. \n \nSummary conviction penalty: \n \nQUESTION: Which section of the criminal code states the standard of proof required in criminal cases?
