offence which is a crime under the provisions of
the Code:
(2) When in any statute, statutory rule, local law, by-law, or
other instrument, public or private, the term murder is

other instrument, public or private, the term larceny is

crime of stealing:
(4) When in any statute, statutory rule, local law, by-law, or
other instrument, public or private, reference is made to
any offence by any specific name, it shall be taken that
reference is intended to the offence which, under the
provisions of the Code, is constituted by the act or
omission that would heretofore have constituted the
offence referred to:
(5) When in any statute, statutory rule, local law, by-law, or
other instrument, public or private, reference is made to

all parts of His Majesty’s dominions not expressly excepted

[Section 4 amended: No. 4 of 2004 s. 58.]
5. No civil action for lawful acts; saving
When, by the Code, any act is declared to be lawful, no action
can be brought in respect thereof.

any right of action which any person would have had against
another if this Act had not been passed; nor shall the omission
from the Code of any penal provision in respect of any act or
omission, which before the time of the coming into operation of
the Code constituted an actionable wrong, affect any right of
action in respect thereof.
[6. Deleted: No. 78 of 1995 s. 22.]
7. Contempt of court powers not affected
Nothing in this Act or in the Code shall affect the authority of
courts of record to punish a person summarily for the offence

cannot be so punished, and also punished under the provisions
of the Code for the same act or omission.

4. Term used: attempt to commit offence
When a person, intending to commit an offence, begins to put
his intention into execution by doing an act that is more than
merely preparatory to the commission of the offence but does
not fulfil his intention to such an extent as to commit the
offence, he is said to attempt to commit the offence.
It is immaterial, except so far as regards punishment, whether
the offender does all that is necessary on his part for completing
the commission of the offence, or whether the complete
fulfilment of his intention is prevented by circumstances
independent of his will, or whether he desists of his own motion
from the further prosecution of his intention.
It is immaterial that by reason of circumstances not known to
the offender, it is impossible in fact to commit the offence.

decides under subsection (3) that the charge is to be tried
on indictment; or
(b) this Code or another written law expressly provides to
the contrary.
(3) The court may decide the charge is to be tried on indictment if
and only if it considers —
(a) that the circumstances in which the offence was
allegedly committed are so serious that, if the accused
were convicted of the offence, the court would not be
able to adequately punish the accused; or
(ba) that the circumstances in which the offence was
allegedly committed are such that, if the accused were
convicted of the offence, the Sentencing Act 1995 Part 2
Division 2A would apply to the sentencing of the
accused for that offence; or
(b) that the charge forms part of a course of conduct during
which other offences were allegedly committed by the
accused and the accused is to be tried on indictment for
one or more of those other offences; or
(c) that a co-accused of the accused is to be tried on
indictment; or
(d) that the charge forms part of a course of conduct during
which other offences were allegedly committed by the
accused and others and the accused or one of the others
is to be tried on indictment for one or more of those
other offences; or
(e) that the interests of justice require that the charge be
dealt with on indictment.
(4) For the purposes of making a decision under subsection (3) the
court —
(a) may require the prosecutor to provide any information
the court needs and may hear submissions from both the
prosecutor and the accused; and

the Criminal Procedure Act 2004.
(6) A decision cannot be made under subsection (3) after the
accused has pleaded to the charge.
(7) A decision made under subsection (3) is final and cannot be
appealed.
(8) If the court convicts the accused of the offence charged
(whether after a plea of guilty or otherwise), the accused is
liable to the summary conviction penalty provided for the
offence, unless the court commits the accused for sentence.
(9) If the court —
(a) convicts the accused of the offence charged after a plea
of guilty or otherwise; and
(b) considers that any sentence the court could impose on
the accused for the offence would not be commensurate
with the seriousness of the offence,
the court may commit the accused to a court of competent
jurisdiction for sentence.
(10) An accused who is committed for sentence under subsection (9)
is liable to the penalty with which the offence is punishable on
indictment.
(11) For the purposes of this section and of any summary trial of the
charge, the court must be constituted by a magistrate alone.

made the omission; and he may be charged with himself doing
the act or making the omission.
8. Offence committed in prosecution of common purpose
(1) When 2 or more persons form a common intention to prosecute
an unlawful purpose in conjunction with one another, and in the
prosecution of such purpose an offence is committed of such a
nature that its commission was a probable consequence of the
prosecution of such purpose, each of them is deemed to have
committed the offence.
(2) A person is not deemed under subsection (1) to have committed
the offence if, before the commission of the offence, the person —
(a) withdrew from the prosecution of the unlawful purpose;
and
(b) by words or conduct, communicated the withdrawal to
each other person with whom the common intention to
prosecute the unlawful purpose was formed; and
(c) having so withdrawn, took all reasonable steps to
prevent the commission of the offence.
[Section 8 amended: No. 89 of 1986 s. 4.]
9. Counselled offence, mode of execution immaterial
When a person counsels another to commit an offence, and an
offence is actually committed after such counsel by the person
to whom it is given, it is immaterial whether the offence actually
committed is the same as that counselled or a different one, or
whether the offence is committed in the way counselled, or in a
different way, provided in either case that the acts constituting
the offence actually committed are a probable consequence of
carrying out the counsel.

22. Ignorance of law, honest claim of right
Ignorance of the law does not afford any excuse for an act or
omission which would otherwise constitute an offence, unless
knowledge of the law by an offender is expressly declared to be
an element of the offence.
But a person is not criminally responsible, as for an offence
relating to property, for an act done or omitted to be done by
him with respect to any property in the exercise of an honest
claim of right and without intention to defraud.
23. Intention and motive
(1) Unless the intention to cause a particular result is expressly
declared to be an element of the offence constituted, in whole or
part, by an act or omission, the result intended to be caused by
an act or omission is immaterial.
(2) Unless otherwise expressly declared, the motive by which a
person is induced to do or omit to do an act, or to form an
intention, is immaterial so far as regards criminal responsibility.

by accident.
(3) If death or grievous bodily harm —
(a) is directly caused to a victim by another person’s act that
involves a deliberate use of force; but

or weakness in the victim,
the other person is not, for that reason alone, excused from
criminal responsibility for the death or grievous bodily harm.
(4) Subsection (3) applies —
(a) even if the other person did not intend or foresee the
death or grievous bodily harm; and
(b) even if the death or grievous bodily harm was not
reasonably foreseeable.

24. Mistake of fact
A person who does or omits to do an act under an honest and
reasonable, but mistaken, belief in the existence of any state of
things is not criminally responsible for the act or omission to
any greater extent than if the real state of things had been such
as he believed to exist.
The operation of this rule may be excluded by the express or
implied provisions of the law relating to the subject.
25. Emergency

of sound mind at any time which comes in question, until the
contrary is proved.
27. Insanity
(1) A person is not criminally responsible for an act or omission on
account of unsoundness of mind if at the time of doing the act or
making the omission he is in such a state of mental impairment
as to deprive him of capacity to understand what he is doing, or
of capacity to control his actions, or of capacity to know that he
ought not to do the act or make the omission.
(2) A person whose mind, at the time of his doing or omitting to do
an act, is affected by delusions on some specific matter or
matters, but who is not otherwise entitled to the benefit of
subsection (1), is criminally responsible for the act or omission
to the same extent as if the real state of things had been such as
he was induced by the delusions to believe to exist.

The term provocation used with reference to an offence of

immediate care, or to whom he stands in a conjugal, parental,
filial, or fraternal relation, to deprive him of the power of self
control, and to induce him to assault the person by whom the act
or insult is done or offered.
When such an act or insult is done or offered by one person to
another, or in the presence of another, to a person who is under
the immediate care of that other, or to whom the latter stands in
any such relation as aforesaid, the former is said to give to the
latter provocation for an assault.
A lawful act is not provocation to any person for an assault.
An act which a person does in consequence of incitement given
by another person in order to induce him to do the act and
thereby to furnish an excuse for committing an assault, is not
provocation to that other person for an assault.
An arrest which is unlawful is not necessarily provocation for an
assault, but it may be evidence of provocation to a person who
knows of the illegality.
[Section 245 amended: No. 4 of 2004 s. 61(1).]
246. Defence of provocation
A person is not criminally responsible for an assault committed
upon a person who gives him provocation for the assault, if he is
in fact deprived by the provocation of the power of self-control,
and acts upon it on the sudden and before there is time for his
passion to cool; provided that the force used is not
disproportionate to the provocation, and is not intended, and is
not such as is likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm.
Whether any particular act or insult is such as to be likely to
deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control and to
induce him to assault the person by whom the act or insult is
done or offered, and whether, in any particular case, the person
provoked was actually deprived by the provocation of the power

of self-control, and whether any force used is or is not
disproportionate to the provocation, are questions of fact.
247. Repetition of insult, use of force to prevent
It is lawful for any person to use such force as is reasonably
necessary to prevent the repetition of an act or insult of such a
nature as to be provocation to him for an assault; provided that
the force used is not intended, and is not such as is likely, to
cause death or grievous bodily harm.
248. Self-defence
(1) In this section —
harmful act means an act that is an element of an offence under
this Part other than Chapter XXXV.
(2) A harmful act done by a person is lawful if the act is done in
self-defence under subsection (4).
(3) If —
(a) a person unlawfully kills another person in
circumstances which, but for this section, would
constitute murder; and
(b) the person’s act that causes the other person’s death
would be an act done in self-defence under
subsection (4) but for the fact that the act is not a
reasonable response by the person in the circumstances
as the person believes them to be,
the person is guilty of manslaughter and not murder.
(4) A person’s harmful act is done in self-defence if —
(a) the person believes the act is necessary to defend the
person or another person from a harmful act, including a
harmful act that is not imminent; and
(b) the person’s harmful act is a reasonable response by the
person in the circumstances as the person believes them
to be; and

(5) A person’s harmful act is not done in self-defence if it is done to
defend the person or another person from a harmful act that is
lawful.

where it was done, and another person has acquired a lawful
title to it, a subsequent receiving of the thing is not an offence
although the receiver knows that the thing had previously been
so obtained.

of indictable offence
Any person who corruptly receives or obtains, or corruptly
agrees to receive or obtain, any property or benefit of any kind
