                   "frames to ensure the legal right to recover the land is not forfeited. If you believe your "
                   "situation involves trespassing and a right to recover land, it would be advisable to commence the "
                   "action as soon as possible.",

                   "foreseeable or not, the individual is still criminally responsible. The law further specifies "
                   "mandatory minimum penalties if the offence is committed during an aggravated home burglary. For "
                   "an adult offender, a term of imprisonment of at least 75% of the specified 20 years must be "
                   "imposed. For a juvenile offender, a minimum of 3 years imprisonment or detention must be imposed.",

    'question_04': "In Western Australia, the penalty for stealing is established under section 378 of the Criminal "

                   'to endanger human life. Conversely if a person unlawfully kills another but the circumstances do '
                   'not meet any of these parameters, this may not be constituted as murder under this section. '
                   'Rather, it may be classified as manslaughter or another offence as stated in Section 277, '
                   'which reads, "Any person who unlawfully kills another is guilty of a crime which, according to '
                   'the circumstances of the case, may be murder or manslaughter". The exact classification will '

                   "a certain period, the authority has the right to re-home the dogs. In the case of dangerous dogs, "
                   "they can also be ordered for destruction under Section 33G or Section 39 of the act. If a dog "
                   "attack has taken place, according to Section 33D and 40, the courts or the State Administrative "
                   "Tribunal could also order the seizure and detention of the dog.",

    'question_41': "In Western Australia, the registration of a cat can be cancelled under several circumstances "
                   "according to the Cat Act. Firstly, if the cat has died; secondly, if the cat is no longer kept in "
                   "the State; and thirdly, if the cat has been registered with another local government. Lastly, "
                   "the registration of the cat can also be cancelled if the owner of the cat has been convicted "

                   "result in a penalty a $5,000 fine. However, a cat is exempt from this microchip requirement "
                   "if a veterinarian certifies that implantation of a microchip could adversely affect the cat's "
                   "health and welfare. It should be noted that this exemption doesn't apply to a cat that is under 6 "
                   "months of age. Therefore, effectively, the age limit by which a cat must be microchipped in "

                   "found to illicitly conduct cat breeding. Additionally, if a person is convicted of such an "
                   "offence, the court has the power to order the sterilisation all cats owned by the offender. This "
                   "order can act as a court judgement, meaning it can be legally enforced. This legislation "
                   "underscores the importance of obtaining proper approval before entering into the cat breeding "
                   "business. To legally breed cats, you must apply for approval through your local government "

                   "a cat that has not been identified or claimed within the specified period, or if an owner has "
                   "surrendered the cat to the facility.",

                   "caring for the cat, and the implantation of a microchip in the cat as per section 33. Costs "
                   "associated with the sterilisation of the cat under section 33 and the destruction and disposal of "
                   "the cat under section 34 are also included. The operator of the cat management facility may "
                   "recover these costs from the owner through a court of competent jurisdiction. It's crucial, "
                   "as a cat owner in WA, to be aware of these potential costs should your cat end up in a cat "
                   "management facility.",

    'question_46': "In Western Australia, the unauthorized provision of adoption services is addressed under the "

                   "requirement in certain circumstances, such as if the parent cannot be located or is incapable of "
                   "giving consent.",

    'question_48': "In Western Australia, according to section 18(1)(a) of the Adoption Act 1994 (WA), consent to a "
                   "child's adoption must be given at least 28 days after the child is born. Additionally, "
                   "section 18(1)(b) adds that the consent also needs to be given at least 28 days after the person "
                   "whose consent is required receives the necessary information and, if requested, the counselling "
                   "mentioned in clause 1 of Schedule 1. Therefore, a minimum period of 28 days must elapse after the "
                   "birth of the child before consent for the child's adoption can be considered valid. It is "
                   "important to comply with these requirements to ensure the legality of the adoption process.",

    'question_49': "In Western Australia, under the Adoption Act, parental responsibility ceases when a child has "
                   "been adopted as per Section 138B(1)(b). Following an adoption, the adoptive parents assume all "
                   "parental responsibilities for the child. Furthermore, if the laws of the overseas jurisdiction "
                   "where the adoption transpired do not treat the relationship between the child and their birth "
                   "parents as that of child and parent, this relationship effectively ceases post adoption. It also "
                   "mentions in Section 138B(1)(d) that if a child has previously been adopted, the previous adoption "
                   "ceases its effect. However, Section 136B provides a recourse for parties to apply to the court "
                   "for an order terminating the parent-child relationship if the laws of the country in which the "
                   "adoption took place do not provide such provision.",

    'question_50': "In Western Australia, the Adoption Act 1994 regulates adoptions. According to its provisions, "
                   "a person or a couple may apply to adopt a child if they meet specific criteria set out in Section "
                   "39 of the Act. It includes being at least 18 years old and having been a or domicile of Western "
                   "Australia for a minimum of 5 years. The Court must also find that the applicant fit and proper "
                   "person(s) to fulfill the responsibilities of parenting and provide a suitable home, education, "
                   "and upbringing. If the applicant is a couple, they must be married or in a de facto relationship "
                   "(including same-sex relationships) for a minimum of three years. It is crucial to note that the "
                   "Court has the discretion to waive some of these requirements. This law will govern you assuming "
                   "that your situation is taking place in Western Australia."
