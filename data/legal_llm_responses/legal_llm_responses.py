    'question_01': "In Western Australia, the section of the Limitation Act 2005 that specifies the limitation period "
                   "for commencing an action to recover land since trespassing accrued is Section 19. Section 19(1) "
                   "states that an action to recover cannot be commenced if 12 years have elapsed since the cause of "
                   "action accrued. However, Section 19(2) provides an exception for the Crown or a person claiming "
                   "through the Crown on a cause of action which accrues to the Crown. In such cases, an action to "
                   "recover land may be commenced at any time. It's crucial that action is taken within these time "
                   "frames to ensure the legal right to recover the land is not forfeited. If you believe your "
                   "situation involves trespassing and a right to recover land, it would be advisable to commence the "
                   "action as soon as possible.",

    'question_02': "Section 313 of the Criminal Code of Western Australia stipulates the penalties for Common "
                   "assault. According to subsection 1, anyone convicted of unlawfully assaulting another individual "
                   "is guilty of a simple offence and is liable to either imprisonment for 3 years and a fine of $36,"
                   "000, if the offence was committed in circumstances of racial or other aggravation (ref. "
                   "subsection 1(a)), or imprisonment for 18 months and a fine of $18,000 in any other case (ref. "
                   "subsection 1(b)). Furthermore, subsection 2 states that a prosecution for an offence under "
                   "subsection 1 can be commenced at any time, implying there is no statute of limitations applicable "
                   "to common assault charges and prosecution can be initiated regardless of when the alleged offence "
                   "occurred.",

    'question_03': "Section 281 of the Western Australian criminal code specifies the penalty for an unlawful assault "
                   "causing death. According to Subsection (1) of Section 281, a person who unlawfully assaults "
                   "another, resulting in the death of the assaulted individual, either directly or indirectly from "
                   "assault, is guilty of a crime. The penalty for this crime is imprisonment for a maximum of 20 "
                   "years. Regardless of whether the person or foresaw the death or if the death was reasonably "
                   "foreseeable or not, the individual is still criminally responsible. The law further specifies "
                   "mandatory minimum penalties if the offence is committed during an aggravated home burglary. For "
                   "an adult offender, a term of imprisonment of at least 75% of the specified 20 years must be "
                   "imposed. For a juvenile offender, a minimum of 3 years imprisonment or detention must be imposed.",

    'question_04': "In Western Australia, the penalty for stealing is established under section 378 of the Criminal "
                   "Code Compilation Act 1913. According to this section, stealing is a crime punishable by "
                   "imprisonment for seven years. However, if the property stolen is a firearm or a replica of a "
                   "firearm, the penalty increases to imprisonment for 14 years. If the offence occurs during a "
                   "public disorder event, the maximum term of imprisonment extends to 21 years. Further to this, "
                   "section 426A of the same Act states that a higher penalty would be applied for a person convicted "
                   "of a stealing offence if they have committed and have been convicted of at least 2 other stealing "
                   "offences within the period of 1 year before their conviction for the current stealing offence. In "
                   "such cases, the summary conviction penalty in section 426(4) does not apply.",

    'question_05': "The sections of the Criminal Code in Western Australia that pertain to fraud include Section 378, "
                   "which outlines the penalties for committing an offence analogous to stealing; Section 380, "
                   "which pertains to fraudulently concealing a will; and Section 386, which deals with fraudulent "
                   "concealing of mining royalties. Section 387 relates to defraud by collecting guano without lawful "
                   "authority. Section 421 pertains to making false business-related statements with the intent to "
                   "manipulate stock value. Section 422 provides a defence for the offences defined in the chapter, "
                   "including fraud. Section 424 criminalizes fraudulent falsification of records. In summary, "
                   "fraud-related offences are scattered in different sections and chapters of the Criminal Code in "
                   "Western Australia, with penalties varying as per the nature and severity of the offence. "
                   "Therefore, it is vital to refer to the specific section when seeking information related to fraud.",

    'question_06': 'Section 279(1) of the Criminal Code outlines the conditions under which killing of another person '
                   'is considered to be legally defined as murder These include an intention to cause death or '
                   'injury, causing death in the course of an unlawful act, or death through an applied method likely '
                   'to endanger human life. Conversely if a person unlawfully kills another but the circumstances do '
                   'not meet any of these parameters, this may not be constituted as murder under this section. '
                   'Rather, it may be classified as manslaughter or another offence as stated in Section 277, '
                   'which reads, "Any person who unlawfully kills another is guilty of a crime which, according to '
                   'the circumstances of the case, may be murder or manslaughter". The exact classification will '
                   'depend on the specific circumstances surrounding the act of killing.',

    'question_07': "The legal jurisdiction for this question is Australia, specifically Western Australia. You should "
                   "refer to the Criminal Code Act Compilation Act 1913 of Western Australia, specifically Section "
                   "23B for the defence of accident which is found under Part IV - Parties to Offences. This section "
                   "states that if an event that resulted in death or grievous bodily harm was not intended by the "
                   "accused, and the event was an accident or outside of the accused’s control, then the accused will "
                   "not be criminally responsible for this event. This is a potential defence to a number of offences "
                   "including offences causing bodily harm or death. sure to gather all evidence that might prove the "
                   "incident was an accident including any existing footage, witnesses, and potential expert "
                   "witnesses depending on the nature of the accident. The advice should be confirmed depending on "
                   "specific circumstances of the case.",

    'question_08': "In the Criminal Code Act Compilation Act 1913 of Western Australia, the term 'applies force' is "
                   "covered under the section related to assault. Here, 'applies force' is interpreted as direct or "
                   "indirect physical contact which could range from hitting, pushing, touching to throwing an object "
                   "at a person. However, it's also essential to understand that in a broader legal context, "
                   "applying force could inadvertently include actions that compel a person to move, act or refrain "
                   "from acting against their will, even though direct physical contact may not occur. This includes "
                   "instances where the victim was compelled to move due the offender's actions, which could also "
                   "potentially constitute the application of force. However, each situation is unique, "
                   "thus the direct interpretation of 'applying force' should be assessed on a case-by-case basis "
                   "according to respective circumstances and within the purview of the relevant law. The context and "
                   "intent of the action, along with its result, tend to influence the categorization.",

    'question_09': "The Criminal Code in Australia or Western Australia does not explicitly state the standard of "
                   "proof required in criminal cases. The standard of proof in criminal is a matter of common law, "
                   "which means it is determined by court decisions over time and not directly in statutes. For "
                   "criminal cases, the standard is 'beyond a reasonable doubt'. means that the prosecution must "
                   "prove the defendant's guilt such an extent that a reasonable person would have no doubt about it. "
                   "If there is any reasonable doubt, the defendant must be acquitted. The burden of proof is also on "
                   "the prosecution in criminal cases - it is the prosecution's responsibility to prove guilt, "
                   "not the defendant's responsibility to prove innocence. Any failure to meet these standards can "
                   "lead to an appeal. This concept is fundamental to the criminal justice system and is universally "
                   "applied.",

    'question_10': "In Western Australia, the equation of specific imprisonment periods for aggravated home burglary "
                   "offences is covered under various sections of the legislation. Section 279, 280, 281, 283, 325, "
                   "326, 327, and 328 reflect this. The specific minimum sentence depends on the severity of the "
                   "offence associated with the aggravated burglary. For example, Section 280 relates to "
                   "manslaughter, specifying a minimum of 15 years if committed by an adult offender during an "
                   "aggravated burglary. Similarly, sections 325, 326 (related to sexual penetration without "
                   "consent), 327 (sexual coercion), 328 (aggravated sexual coercion) denote that if offences are "
                   "committed during an aggravated home burglary by an adult offender, then the court must impose a "
                   "term of imprisonment of at least 75% of the respective maximum term listed in subsections (1) of "
                   "these sections. For juvenile offenders, a term of 3 years imprisonment or detention is mandatory "
                   "under the same circumstances, as per subsection (3) of these sections.",

    'question_11': "According to the Births, Deaths and Marriages Registration Act 1998 of Western Australia, "
                   "restricted persons for change of name are defined under section 36A and include: prisoners, "
                   "detainees, persons subject to an early release order, supervised offenders, persons recognised as "
                   "reportable offenders, supervised young offenders, and high-risk serious offenders. Applications "
                   "for changing the name of such individuals would need approval from a supervisory authority as "
                   "mentioned in section 36B. Furthermore, section 36C prohibits a restricted person from applying to "
                   "change their name, and section 36D forbids anyone from applying to change the name of a "
                   "restricted person, unless approval from the supervisory authority is obtained. It is pertinent to "
                   "carefully review these sections in accordance with an individual's specific circumstances to "
                   "ensure conformity to the rules.",

    'question_12': "The applicable section in the Western Australia Births, Deaths and Marriages Registration Act "
                   "1998 that restricts changes of a child's name under birth registration is Section 32A. This "
                   "section prohibits the Registrar from registering a change of a child's name on an application "
                   "under Section 31 if a change of the child's name has already been registered in any state within "
                   "12 months immediately preceding the the application is made. However, this restriction does not "
                   "apply if the change of the child's name was registered on an application under Section 23 or 33. "
                   "Additionally, Section 23 allows for a child's given names to be changed once within a year of "
                   "birth under specific conditions and procedures. This includes the requirement that the "
                   "application be made in writing within 12 months after the child's date of birth.",

    'question_13': "In Western Australia, under section 12(2) of the act provided, if the responsible person does not "
                   "give the Registrar notice of a child's birth within one month after the birth in an approved form "
                   "or manner, they can be liable a penalty of up to $1,000. It's important to note that a person "
                   "won't commit an offence under this section if notice of the birth is given by another person. "
                   "Registered hospitals, doctors, midwifes or the person present at the birth, depending on "
                   "circumstances, are typically considered the responsible person. Therefore, it's crucial to follow "
                   "these regulations to avoid incurring the listed penalty.",

    'question_14': "Under the Western Australia Births, Deaths and Marriages Registration Act 1998, Sections 37 and "
                   "38 deal with the registration of marriages. Section 37 states that all marriages taking place "
                   "within the state are subject to registration under this Act. Section 38 delineates the procedure "
                   "for registration, namely that the person responsible for the solemnization of the marriage must "
                   "send a marriage document to the Registrar within 14 days after the marriage.Specifically, "
                   "the person responsible (a celebrant or religious minister) must provide the Registrar with a "
                   "document containing the particulars of the marriage as required by regulation, signed and dated "
                   "by the couple, the witnesses, and the person who solemnized the marriage. The Registrar then "
                   "registers the marriage as long as the document complies with the regulations and the prescribed "
                   "fee has been paid. If further documents or evidence are required, the Registrar has the power to "
                   "request them for a complete registration.",

    'question_15': "In Western Australia, the Births, Deaths and Marriages Registration Act 1998 Section 30A outlines "
                   "restrictions on changes of an adult's name. According to this section, the Registrar will not "
                   "register a change of an adult's name if a change of that adult's name has been registered twice "
                   "in the previous 12 months or four times in the total period up to the date of the current "
                   "application. Additionally, the Registrar will not register the change of an adult's name if the "
                   "change is to a prohibited name as defined in the Act. This law primarily aims to prevent frequent "
                   "name changes and misuse of name change regulations. Eventually, it is the Registrar's discretion "
                   "to determine if a proposed name change should be registered or could be refused based on the "
                   "guidelines outlined in the Act.",

    'question_16': "Yes, in Western Australia (WA), cannabis is listed as a prohibited drug under the Misuse of Drugs "
                   "Act 1981. This includes cannabis resin and cannabis oil. However, exceptions exist for medicinal "

                   "has legal custody of the child, such as a legal guardian. Consent must be fully informed, "
                   "freely given, and in writing. If the child is 12 years old or over, their written consent is "
                   "required unless it is determined that they lack the capacity to understand the implications of "
                   "consent. If the child is under 12 and is capable of grasping the meaning and ramifications of "
                   "adoption, their views should be taken into account. In the case of Aboriginal or Torres Strait "
                   "Islander child, the child's extended family or the Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander community "
                   "to which the child belongs may also provide input. Court may dispense with the consent "
                   "requirement in certain circumstances, such as if the parent cannot be located or is incapable of "
                   "giving consent.",

    'question_48': "In Western Australia, according to section 18(1)(a) of the Adoption Act 1994 (WA), consent to a "
                   "child's adoption must be given at least 28 days after the child is born. Additionally, "
                   "section 18(1)(b) adds that the consent also needs to be given at least 28 days after the person "
                   "whose consent is required receives the necessary information and, if requested, the counselling "
                   "mentioned in clause 1 of Schedule 1. Therefore, a minimum period of 28 days must elapse after the "
                   "birth of the child before consent for the child's adoption can be considered valid. It is "
                   "important to comply with these requirements to ensure the legality of the adoption process.",

    'question_49': "In Western Australia, under the Adoption Act, parental responsibility ceases when a child has "
                   "been adopted as per Section 138B(1)(b). Following an adoption, the adoptive parents assume all "
                   "parental responsibilities for the child. Furthermore, if the laws of the overseas jurisdiction "
                   "where the adoption transpired do not treat the relationship between the child and their birth "
                   "parents as that of child and parent, this relationship effectively ceases post adoption. It also "
                   "mentions in Section 138B(1)(d) that if a child has previously been adopted, the previous adoption "
                   "ceases its effect. However, Section 136B provides a recourse for parties to apply to the court "
                   "for an order terminating the parent-child relationship if the laws of the country in which the "
                   "adoption took place do not provide such provision.",

    'question_50': "In Western Australia, the Adoption Act 1994 regulates adoptions. According to its provisions, "
                   "a person or a couple may apply to adopt a child if they meet specific criteria set out in Section "
                   "39 of the Act. It includes being at least 18 years old and having been a or domicile of Western "
                   "Australia for a minimum of 5 years. The Court must also find that the applicant fit and proper "
                   "person(s) to fulfill the responsibilities of parenting and provide a suitable home, education, "
                   "and upbringing. If the applicant is a couple, they must be married or in a de facto relationship "
                   "(including same-sex relationships) for a minimum of three years. It is crucial to note that the "
                   "Court has the discretion to waive some of these requirements. This law will govern you assuming "
                   "that your situation is taking place in Western Australia."
