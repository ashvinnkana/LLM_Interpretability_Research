    'question_01': 'The relevant section of the law in Western Australia that stipulates the limitation period for '
                   'commencing an action to recover land since the trespassing accrued is detailed in the Limitation '
                   'Act 2005, under Division 3, section 19. This provision clearly states that an action to recover '
                   'cannot be commenced if 12 years have elapsed since the cause of action accrued. Despite this '
                   'general rule, subsection (2) provides that an action to recover land may be commenced at any time '
                   'if brought by the Crown or a person claiming through the Crown based on a cause of action which '
                   'accrues to the Crown. It is important to accurately determine the time when the cause of action '
                   'accrued to ensure compliance with the limitation period.',

    'question_02': 'Under the Criminal Code of Western Australia, the penalty for "Assault causing bodily harm" is '
                   'specified in Section 317. According to this section, if an individual unlawfully another and '
                   'thereby causes that person bodily harm, they are guilty of a crime. If this crime is committed in '
                   'circumstances of aggravation or racial aggravation, they can be liable to imprisonment for 7 '
                   'years; otherwise, the penalty is imprisonment for 5 years. However, on a summary conviction (if '
                   'the case dealt with in a lesser court), the penalties are reduced to imprisonment for 3 years and '
                   'a fine of $36,000 for cases with aggravation or racial aggravation, and imprisonment for 2 years '
                   'and a fine of $24,000 for all other cases.',

    'question_03': 'According to the Criminal Code of Western Australia, s. 281 contains the specific penalties for '
                   'unlawful assault causing death. A person found guilty of this offence is liable to imprisonment '
                   'for 20 years. If this offence is committed by an adult during an aggravated home burglary, '
                   'the court must impose a term of imprisonment of at least 75% of the term defined in subsection ('
                   '1). If a juvenile commits this crime during an aggravated home burglary, they will either receive '
                   'a term of imprisonment or detention under the Young Offenders Act 1994 of at least 3 years. In '
                   'both instances, the court cannot suspend any term of imprisonment imposed and must record a '
                   'conviction against the offender. Further, the court retains the authority to make specific orders '
                   'or directions under the Young Offenders Act 1994.'
