Content of direction on family violence \n \nIn giving a direction under section 39C, the trial judge must inform the jury that \u2014 \n \n(a) self-defence is, or is likely to be, an issue in the trial; and \n \n(b) as a matter of law, evidence of family violence may be relevant to determining whether the accused acted in self-defence; and \n \n(c) evidence in the trial is likely to include evidence of family violence committed by the victim against the accused or another person whom the accused was defending. \n39F. Additional matters for direction on family violence \n \n(1) In giving a direction requested under section 39C or 39D, the trial judge may include any of the following matters in the direction \u2014 \n \n(a) that family violence \u2014 \n \n(i) is not limited to physical abuse and may, for example, include sexual abuse, psychological abuse or financial abuse; \n \n(ii) may amount to violence against a person even though it is immediately directed at another person;  (iii) may consist of a single act;  (iv) may consist of separate acts that form part of a pattern of behaviour which can amount to abuse even though some or all of those acts may, when viewed in isolation, appear to be minor or trivial; \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) if relevant, that experience shows that \u2014 \n \n(i) people may react differently to family violence and there is no typical, proper or normal response to family violence; \n \n(ii) it is not uncommon for a person who has been subjected to family violence to stay with an abusive partner after the onset of family violence, or to leave and then return to the partner;  (iii) it is not uncommon for a person who has been subjected to family violence not to report family violence to police or seek assistance to stop family violence;  (iv) decisions made by a person subjected to family violence about how to address, respond to or avoid family violence may be influenced by a variety of factors; \n \n(v) it is not uncommon for a decision to leave an abusive partner, or to seek assistance, to increase apprehension about, or the actual risk of, harm; \n \n(c) in the case of self-defence, that, as a matter of law, evidence that the accused assaulted the victim on a previous occasion does not mean that the accused could not have been acting in self-defence in relation to the offence charged. \n \n(2) In making a direction under subsection (1), the trial judge may also indicate that behaviour, or patterns of behaviour, that may constitute family violence may include (but are not limited to) \u2014 \n \n(a) placing or keeping a person in a dependent or subordinate relationship; \n \n(b) isolating a person from family, friends or other sources of support; \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

Application of s. 39E and 39F to criminal proceedings without juries \n \nIf a court is sitting without a jury, the court\u2019s reasoning with respect to any matter in relation to which sections 39E and 39F make provision must, to such extent as the court thinks fit, be consistent with how a jury would be directed in accordance with those sections in the particular case. \n \n95. Section 134 inserted \n \nAfter section 133 insert: \n \n134. Review of amendment made by \nFamily Violence Legislation Reform Act 2020 \n \n(1) The Minister must review the operation and effectiveness of the amendment made to this Act by the \nFamily Violence Legislation Reform Act 2020\n, and prepare a report based on the review, as soon as practicable after the 3\nrd\n anniversary of the day on which the \nFamily Violence Legislation Reform Act 2020\n section 93 comes into operation. \n \n(2) The Minister must cause the report to be laid before each House of Parliament as soon as practicable after it is prepared, but not later than 12 months after the 3\nrd\n \nanniversary. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(3) The Minister must transmit a copy of the report to the Clerk of a House of Parliament if \u2014 \n \n(a) the report has been prepared; and \n \n(b) the Minister is of the opinion that the House will not sit during the period of 21 days after the finalisation of the report. \n \n(4) A copy of the report transmitted to the Clerk of a House is taken to have been laid before that House. \n \n(5) The laying of a copy of a report that is taken to have occurred under subsection (4) must be recorded in the Minutes, or Votes and Proceedings, of the House on the first sitting day of the House after the receipt of the copy by the Clerk. \n \n\u00a9 State of Western Australia 2020.
