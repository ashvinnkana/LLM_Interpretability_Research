Agreement to extend or shorten limitation period \n \n(1) Nothing in this Act prevents a person from agreeing to extend or shorten a limitation period provided for under this Act. \n \n(2) Despite subsection (1), a provision in, or condition of, an agreement is of no effect if it purports to \u2014  \n \n(a) exclude the operation of section 33, 36 or 38; or \n \n(b) extinguish (rather than bar) a right or title in relation to an action in a manner that would be inconsistent with a provision of Part 5. \n \n \n \n \n \nDivision 5 \u2014 Extension by confirmation \n46.

Limitation period extended by confirmation \n \nIf a cause of action lies against a person (either solely or with other persons) and the person confirms the cause of action \u2014  \n \n(a) after the limitation period provided for under this Act for the cause of action begins to run; and \n \n(b) before that limitation period expires,  \n \nthe time during which the limitation period runs before the confirmation is made does not count in the reckoning of the limitation period for an action on the cause of action by a person \n \n \n \n \nhaving the benefit of the confirmation against a person bound by the confirmation. \n48. Formal requirements for acknowledgments \n \nFor the purposes of section 46(1)(a), an acknowledgment is of no effect unless it is in writing and signed by the maker. \n49. Who has benefit of confirmation \n \nFor the purposes of this Act, a person (\nperson A\n) has the benefit of a confirmation if the confirmation is made to person A or to a person through whom person A claims. \n50. Who is bound by confirmation \n \n(1) For the purposes of this Act, a person (\nperson A\n) is bound by a confirmation if \u2014  \n \n(a) person A is a maker of the confirmation; \n \n(b) person A is, in relation to the cause of action, a successor of a maker under a devolution from the maker occurring after the making of the confirmation;  \n \n(c) in the case where the maker is, at the time when the maker makes the confirmation, a personal representative of a deceased person (either solely or with other persons) \u2014 person A is, at or after that time, a personal representative of the deceased person;  \n \n(d) in the case where the maker is, at the time when the maker makes the confirmation, a trustee other than a personal representative of a deceased person (either solely or with other persons) \u2014 person A is, at or after that time, a trustee of the trust of which the maker is a trustee; or \n \n(e) person A is bound under subsection (2). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(2) If a maker of a confirmation of a cause of action in relation to property is in possession of the property when the confirmation is made, the confirmation binds a person subsequently in possession of the property who claims through the maker of the confirmation. \n51. Effects of certain kinds of confirmation \n \n(1) A confirmation of a cause of action to recover interest on principal money operates also as a confirmation of a cause of action to recover the principal money. \n \n(2) A confirmation of a cause of action to recover income becoming due at any time operates also as a confirmation of a cause of action to recover income falling due at a later time on the same account. \nDivision 6 \u2014 Extension of limitation periods \u2014 other matters \n52.

Extinguishment of right and title to land \n \nA person\u2019s right and title to land is extinguished \u2014  \n \n(a) if the person does not commence an action to recover the land before the expiry of the limitation period provided for under this Act; or \n \n(b) if \u2014  \n \n(i) a court extends the time in which the person can commence an action to recover the land; and  \n \n(ii) the person does not commence an action to recover the land before the expiry of the extended period. \n76. No title by adverse possession against Crown \n \nDespite any law that is, or has been, in effect the right, title or interest of the Crown to, or in, any land is not affected in any way by any possession of such land adverse to the Crown, and is to be taken as never having been so affected. \n \n \n \n \n \n77. Future interests in land \n \n(1) If \u2014  \n \n(a) a person\u2019s right to the immediate possession of land is extinguished by this Act; \n \n(b) at any time while the person has that right the person also has a future interest in the land; and \n \n(c) the land is not, before the person becomes entitled to immediate possession of the land, recovered under an intervening interest, \n \nthe future interest is extinguished when the person becomes entitled to immediate possession of the land. \n \n(2) For the purposes of this section, a person has a future interest if \u2014  \n \n(a) the person is contingently entitled to a future interest; or \n \n(b) a future interest is vested in the person subject to divesting in any event. \n78. Provisions in case of land held on trust \n \n(1) If land is held upon trust including a trust for sale and \u2014  \n \n(a) the limitation period for an action by the trustee to recover the land has expired; or \n ",

      "content": "(b) a court extends the time in which the trustee can commence an action to recover the land and the trustee does not commence an action to recover the land before the expiry of the extended period, \n \nthe estate of the trustee is not extinguished so long as the right of action to recover the land of any person entitled to a beneficial interest in the land or in the proceeds of sale either has not accrued or has not been barred by this Act; but if every such right of action has been so barred the estate of the trustee is extinguished. \n \n \n \n \n(2) If land is held upon trust including a trust for sale, an action to recover the land may be brought by the trustee on behalf of any person entitled to a beneficial interest in possession in the land or in the proceeds of sale whose right of action has not been barred by this Act even though the right of action of the trustee would apart from this provision have been barred by this Act. \n \n \n \n \n \nPart 6 \u2014 Miscellaneous \n79. Burden of proof \n \n(1) Subject to subsection (2), a defendant in an action has the burden of proving that the action cannot be commenced because the applicable limitation period has expired. \n \n(2) The plaintiff has the burden of proving that the time mentioned in section 32(1) or 35(1) does not count in the reckoning of the limitation period. \n \n(3) The plaintiff in an extension application has the burden of proving that a court should extend the relevant limitation period. \n80. Grounds in equity upon which to refuse relief preserved \n \nNothing in this Act affects any equitable jurisdiction to refuse relief on the ground of laches, acquiescence or otherwise. \n81. Counterclaims \u2014 commencement \n \n(1) A counterclaim in an action (except a counterclaim solely by way of defence) is, for the purposes of this Act, a separate action. \n \n(2) If a defendant in an action makes a counterclaim against a plaintiff in the action the counterclaim is to be taken to have commenced as against the plaintiff when the defendant became a party to the action. \n \n(3) If a defendant in an action makes a counterclaim against a plaintiff in the action and then joins another person as a party against whom the counterclaim is made the counterclaim is to be taken to have commenced as against the other person when the other person is joined as a party to the counterclaim. \n82. Joint causes of action \n \nIf, were it not for this Act, 2 or more persons would have a cause of action jointly but, because of this Act, an action on the \n \n \n \ncause of action cannot be commenced by one or more of them, an action on the cause of action may nonetheless be commenced by the other or others of them and judgment may be given accordingly. \n83. Joint liability \n \nIf, were it not for this Act, 2 or more persons would be liable on a cause of action jointly but, because of this Act, an action on the cause of action cannot be commenced against one or more of them, an action on the cause of action may nonetheless be commenced against the other or others of them and judgment may be given accordingly. \n84. Formal entry and claim \n \nFor the purposes of this Act \u2014  \n \n(a) a formal entry on land is not of itself possession or evidence of possession of the land; and \n \n(b) a claim in respect of land does not preserve a cause of action to recover the land. \n85. Other beneficiaries \n \nIf a beneficiary under a trust brings an action in relation to the trust (\nbeneficiary 1\u2019s action\n), any other beneficiary under the trust (\nbeneficiary 2\n) is not entitled to derive from beneficiary 1\u2019s action any benefit for which, because of this Act, beneficiary 2 could not have commenced an action when beneficiary 1\u2019s action was commenced. \n86. Limited right to recover tax \n \n(1) This section applies in respect of an action by a person (a \nclaimant\n) to recover, or in relation to the recovery of, any money paid by way of tax or purported tax. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(2) Any judgment by a court in favour of a claimant is to be for only that part of the amount claimed which the court is satisfied \u2014  \n \n(a) has not been charged directly to or recovered directly from another person or, if it has been so charged or recovered, has been refunded to the other person; \n \n(b) will not be charged directly to or recovered directly from another person; and \n \n(c) has not been incorporated into the price of or charge for any property or services. \n \n(3) The claimant has the burden of satisfying the court as to the matters mentioned in subsection (2). \n87.
