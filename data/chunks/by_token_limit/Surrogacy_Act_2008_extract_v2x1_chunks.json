What this Part is about \n \nThis Part deals with the status of surrogacy arrangements and prohibits certain surrogacy arrangements and certain things to do with surrogacy arrangements. \n5. Term used in this Part \n \nIn this Part, unless the contrary intention appears \u2014  \n \nsurrogacy arrangement that is for reward\n has the meaning given in section 6. \n6. Meaning of \u201csurrogacy arrangement that is for reward\u201d \n \n(1) This Part refers to a surrogacy arrangement as being for reward if the arrangement provides for any person to receive any payment or valuable consideration other than for reasonable expenses associated with \u2014  \n \n(a) the pregnancy or the birth; or \n \n(b) any assessment or expert advice in connection with the arrangement. \n \n(2) Reasonable expenses associated with achieving, or attempting to achieve, the pregnancy are reasonable expenses associated with the pregnancy. \n \n(3) An expense is a reasonable expense for the purposes of subsection (1)(a) to the extent only that it is \u2014  \n \n(a) a reasonable medical expense that is not recoverable under any health insurance or other scheme; or \n \n(b) the value of earnings foregone because of leave taken \u2014  \n \n(i) for a period of not more than 2 months during which the birth occurs or was expected to occur; or \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(ii) at any other time for medical reasons arising during the pregnancy; \n \nor \n \n(c) a reasonable expense of psychological counselling; or \n \n(d) a premium payable for health, disability or life insurance that \u2014  \n \n(i) would not have been taken out if the surrogacy arrangement had not been entered into; and \n \n(ii) provides cover for a period during which an expense referred to in another paragraph of this subsection is incurred or might be, or have been expected to be, incurred. \n7. Surrogacy arrangement not binding \n \n(1) A surrogacy arrangement is not enforceable except to the extent provided for in subsection (3). \n \n(2) Subsection (1) does not affect the ability of the court to make an order under Part 3. \n \n(3) An obligation under a surrogacy arrangement to pay or reimburse reasonable expenses referred to in section 6(1) is as enforceable as it would be if subsection (1) had not been enacted and the arrangement was not unenforceable for any other reason. \nDivision 2 \u2014 Offences \n8. Making surrogacy arrangement that is for reward \n \nA person who enters into a surrogacy arrangement that is for reward commits an offence. \n \nPenalty: a fine of $24 000 or imprisonment for 2 years. \n9.

Publishing willingness to make surrogacy arrangement that is for reward \n \nA person commits an offence if the person publishes or causes to be published \u2014  \n \n(a) anything that is intended to, or likely to, induce a person to enter into a surrogacy arrangement that is for reward; or \n \n(b) anything to the effect that a person who is willing to enter into a surrogacy arrangement that is for reward is sought; or \n \n(c) anything to the effect that a person is or might be willing to enter into a surrogacy arrangement that is for reward. \n \nPenalty: a fine of $6 000. \n11. Services connected with surrogacy arrangement that is for reward \n \n(1) A person who provides a service knowing that the service is to facilitate a surrogacy arrangement that is for reward commits a crime except in the circumstances described in subsection (2). \n \n(2) It is not an offence against subsection (1) if the service is a health service provided to the birth mother after she has become pregnant. \n \nPenalty: imprisonment for 5 years. \n \nSummary conviction penalty: a fine of $12 000 or imprisonment for one year. \n \n \n \n \n \nPart 3 \u2014 Order giving parental status to arranged parents \nDivision 1 \u2014 Preliminary \n12. What this Part is about \n \nThis Part is to enable the court to transfer, from the birth parents to the arranged parents, the parentage of a child born under a surrogacy arrangement in certain circumstances. \n13. Child\u2019s best interests paramount \n \n(1) In deciding whether to make a particular decision concerning a parentage order or proposed parentage order about a child, the court must regard the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration. \n ",

      "content": ") in accordance with section 22; and \n \n(g) it is in the best interests of the child for the court to make the proposed order. \n \n(3) In circumstances identified in subsection (4) or if the court is satisfied that a birth parent is deceased or incapacitated or that the arranged parents have been unable to contact a birth parent despite having made reasonable efforts to do so, the court may dispense with \u2014  \n \n(a) the requirement for the birth parent to have received counselling as described in subsection (2)(b); or \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the requirement for the birth parent to have received independent legal advice as described in subsection (2)(c); or \n \n(c) the requirement for the birth parent to consent under subsection (2)(d) to the making of a parentage order; or \n \n(d) the requirement for the birth parent to have agreed to an appropriate plan as described in subsection (2)(f). \n \n(4) The circumstances this subsection identifies are that \u2014 \n \n(a) the birth mother is not the child\u2019s genetic parent; and \n \n(b) at least one arranged parent is the child\u2019s genetic parent. \n \n(5) In subsection (4) \u2014  \n \ngenetic parent\n of a child means a person from whose egg or sperm the child is conceived. \n22. Contents of approved plan \n \n(1) The plan needed to satisfy the court as section 21(2)(f) requires may deal with any matter relating to the child, and has to \u2014  \n \n(a) adequately balance the rights and responsibilities of the parties to the plan; and \n \n(b) promote the child\u2019s long-term welfare; and \n \n(c) be reasonable in the circumstances. \n \n(2) Without limiting the matters that the plan may deal with, the plan has to set out details of \u2014  \n \n(a) any time that the child is to spend, or communication that the child is to have, with the child\u2019s birth parents or any other person; and \n \n(b) any information that any of the parties is to provide to the other or to any other person. \n23. Ancillary orders \n \nWhen the court makes a parentage order it may make any consequential or ancillary order it thinks fit in the interests of \n \n \n \n \n \n24. Multiple births \n \n(1) This section applies if an application is made for a parentage order about a child who has a living brother or sister born as a result of the same pregnancy as the child (a \nliving birth sibling\n). \n \n(2) The court cannot make a parentage order about a child who has a living birth sibling unless it also makes a parentage order about each living birth sibling of the child. \n25. Name of child \n \n(1) If a parentage order is made, the court is to, by the same order, declare the name by which the child whose parentage is transferred is to be known. \n \n(2) Before making an order changing the child\u2019s name, the court is to have regard to \u2014  \n \n(a) the principle that a child\u2019s first name should not be changed by a parentage order except in special circumstances; and \n \n(b) anything that is relevant in the approved plan. \n \n(3) An order under this section does not prevent a subsequent change of name under a law of the State or the Commonwealth. \n26. Effect of parentage order \n \n(1) The effect of a parentage order is that, for the purposes of the law of this State \u2014  \n \n(a) the relationship between the child whose parentage is transferred and each of the arranged parents is to be treated as being that of child and parent; and \n \n(b) the relationship between the child whose parentage is transferred and each of the child\u2019s birth parents is to be treated as not being that of child and parent; and \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the relationships of all persons to the child whose parentage is transferred, to each of the arranged parents, and to each of the birth parents of the child are to be determined in accordance with this section. \n \n(2) If a parentage order is made, an appointment, in a deed or will existing at the time the parentage order is made, of a person as the guardian of the child whose parentage is transferred, ceases to have effect. \n27. Discharge of parentage order \n \n(1) The court may, if satisfied as described in subsection (2), make an order discharging a parentage order on receiving an application for it to do so from \u2014  \n \n(a) the Attorney General; or \n \n(b) the chief executive officer; or \n \n(c) the chief executive officer of the department of the Public Service principally assisting in the administration of the \nAdoption Act 1994\n; or \n \n(d) a child whose parentage was transferred by the parentage order who has reached the age of 18 years. \n ",

Relationships for laws relating to sexual offences \n \nFor the purposes of the law of this State relating to sexual offences, being law for the purposes of which the relationship between persons is relevant \u2014  \n \n(a) despite section 26(1) and (2), a parentage order does not cause the cessation of any relationship that would have existed if the parentage order had not been made, and any such relationship is to be treated as existing in addition to any relationship that exists by virtue of the application of this section in relation to the parentage order; and \n \n(b) despite section 27(9), the discharge of a parentage order does not cause the cessation of any relationship that would have existed if the discharging order had not been made, and any such relationship is to be treated as existing in addition to any relationship that exists by virtue of the discharge of the parentage order. \n \n \n \n \n \n29. Finality of parentage order \n \nA parentage order cannot be appealed against, reviewed, called in question, or affected by any court, on any account, except \u2014  \n \n(a) under section 27; or \n \n(b) under the \nFamily Court Act 1997\n section 211(3). \n30. Varying approved plan \n \n(1) A person described in subsection (2) may apply to the court for approval to vary an approved plan relating to a child if the child has not reached 18 years of age. \n \n(2) The only person who can make the application is \u2014  \n \n(a) a person who is a party to the approved plan; or \n \n(b) a birth parent who is not a party to the approved plan. \n ",

Court\u2019s powers to do with breach of approved plan \n \n(1) If, on an application made to it by a party to an approved plan, the court is satisfied that a breach of a provision of the plan has occurred or is likely to occur, the court may \u2014  \n \n(a) order the parties to the plan to participate in a mediation process; or \n \n(b) exercise its powers under the \nFamily Court Act 1997\n, as it thinks fit, to enforce a provision of the plan as if the provision were an order made by the court under that Act. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(2) Without limiting subsection (1), the court may deal with a breach of a provision of an approved plan as if the person who breached the provision had contravened an order made by the court under the \nFamily Court Act 1997\n or had been in contempt of the court. \n32.

Application of this Division or order under it \n \n(1) If an approved plan provides for a party to the plan to have greater or earlier access to information than would be available under this Division, the party is entitled to access in accordance with the plan. \n \n(2) A right that this Division gives to have access to information or an order that the court makes giving access to information prevails over a provision of any contract or approved plan that purports to restrict or exclude that access. \n35.
