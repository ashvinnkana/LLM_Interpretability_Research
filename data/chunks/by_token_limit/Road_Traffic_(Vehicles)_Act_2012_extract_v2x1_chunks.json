Default categorisation \n \n(1) If a court is satisfied that there has been a breach of a mass, dimension or loading requirement but is not satisfied that the breach is a substantial risk breach or a severe risk breach, it may treat the breach as a minor risk breach. \n \n(2) If a court is satisfied that there has been a breach of a mass, dimension or loading requirement and that the breach is at least a substantial risk breach but is not satisfied that the breach is a severe risk breach, it may treat the breach as a substantial risk breach. \n120. Matters to be considered by courts when sentencing \n \n(1) When a court is determining the kind and level of sanction to be imposed in respect of a breach of a mass, dimension or loading requirement it is to have regard to each of the following propositions relating to the breach \u2014  \n \n(a) that a minor risk breach may give rise to either or both of the following \u2014  \n \n(i) an appreciable risk of accelerated road wear; \n \n(ii) an appreciable risk of unfair commercial advantage; \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) that a substantial risk breach may give rise to one or more of the following \u2014  \n \n(i) a substantial risk of accelerated road wear; \n \n(ii) an appreciable risk of damage to road infrastructure; \n \n(iii) an appreciable risk of increased traffic congestion; \n \n(iv) an appreciable risk of diminished public amenity; \n \n(v) a substantial risk of unfair commercial advantage; \n \n(c) that a severe risk breach may give rise to one or more of the following \u2014  \n \n(i) an appreciable risk of harm to public safety or the environment; \n \n(ii) a serious risk of accelerated road wear; \n \n(iii) a serious risk of harm to road infrastructure; \n \n(iv) a serious risk of increased traffic congestion; \n \n(v) a serious risk of diminished public amenity; \n \n(vi) a serious risk of unfair commercial advantage. \n \n(2) It is not necessary to adduce evidence in support of a proposition mentioned in subsection (1) but a court may require or consider evidence in relation to the relevance and significance of the proposition in a particular case. \n \n(3) Nothing in this section affects any other matter that may or must be taken into consideration by a court. \n \n(4) Nothing in this section authorises or requires a court to assign the breach to a different category of breach. \n121.
